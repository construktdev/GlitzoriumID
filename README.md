# GlitzoriumID | GlitzoriumLink

- Connect your Minecraft Account to your Discord Account

- I need this for a future update of the Main Plugin

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a Env.java Class:

```java
// Put in the Token of the Discord Application you'd like to use
// It can be obtained at https://discord.com/developers/applications
public static String TOKEN = "Your Token";

// This should be the role users are supposed to get when they verified
// It NEEDS to be the ID! Not the name!
public static String LINKED_ID = "ID";
```

3. Build and compile it
